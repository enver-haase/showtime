Cheat Sheet:

Change the current directory to the demo project folder and then:
 mvn jetty:run-forked

In the browser:
 http://localhost:8080/projectname
or
 http://localhost:8080/projectname/?debug

The "?debug" works only when the Vaadin application was compiled in
debug mode, and it shows a window which allows you to measure performance
and to identify web elements (such as buttons, ...) so that you can
use those selectors for Vaadin TestBench 4.
To achieve the latter, press the tab with the checklist-clipboard icon,
and then in the sub-tab the for-arrow picker icon left of the trashcan
icon. Then select any element. You will get a description such as
"TextFieldElement firstNameTextField = $(TextFieldElement.class).caption("First Name").first();".
This text you can select with the mouse and then use the known keyboard
shortcuts to copy-and-paste those into your TestBench 4 code.


When running
 mvn -Pci-tests jetty:run-forked
then the test cases including the test database are deployed as well,
plus the "database.backend" Java system property is set to the class name
of a simple mock database.
When running the unit and integration tests against the application then
Jetty should be started as shown above, as the tests expect the mock database
contents.
